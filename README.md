# DELAY
A script that takes in the speed file pulled from the RITIS PDA API, and the TMC profiles file, and calculates Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), Person Hours of Delay (PHD), Vehicle Hours of Delay (VHD) and User Delay Cost. Commercial (trucking) and passenger metrics are calculated and then summed to get total PHD/VHD.

All performance metrics were calculated in 21.3 seconds for an entire month aggregated at 15 minute intervals.
